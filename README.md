# Shared SME & Education Cloud – Proof of Concept

This repository contains a **globally applicable Proof of Concept (PoC)**
for a secure, low-cost, and sustainable shared cloud platform designed to support:

- Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)
- Private and public schools
- NGOs and public-sector stakeholders

The platform aggregates repurposed corporate IT hardware into a resilient,
multi-tenant cloud storage and access service using enterprise-grade,
RHEL-compatible Linux distributions (e.g. Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux)
and open-source technologies.

## Key Characteristics
- Multi-tenant, logically isolated architecture
- Secure hybrid access (private network + public internet)
- Child-safe access model for educational institutions
- Vendor-neutral and region-agnostic design
- Environmentally sustainable (hardware reuse, low carbon impact)
